A Tool for Visualization, Understanding, and Analyzing Data Structures
📌 Overview

This project is a Java-based interactive tool that helps students and developers visualize and analyze data structures. Instead of only studying theory, users can see how operations are executed step-by-step, which makes learning more effective and intuitive.

✨ Features

📊 Visualization of Core Data Structures – Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, etc.

🧩 Step-by-Step Execution – Perform insertions, deletions, traversals, and searches with visual feedback.

⚡ Java-Powered – Implemented fully in Java with a simple, user-friendly interface.

🔍 Performance Insights – Analyze time and space complexities of different operations.

🎓 Learning-Oriented – Ideal for students, interview prep, and strengthening CS fundamentals.

🎯 Objectives

Simplify complex data structure concepts through visualization

Bridge the gap between theory and practical understanding

Support learners in competitive programming and interviews

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Java

GUI: Java Swing / JavaFX (for visualization and interactivity)
